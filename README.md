# PlanetariumEquipmentGUI_HTML
Example of User Interface for Planetarium Equipment using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Comments welcome.


This interface is part of a larger project that includes a Java (working on C# .Net version now) based desktop application that provides the webserver for the interface.  The idea is to have an interface that could be easily modified to accommodate the various equipment installations in planetarium.

The desktop application provides a link between a modern User Interface and a legacy MS-DOS based control system.  The MS-DOS control system is connected to various pieces of equipment (lights, sound, video, special effects, and analog star machines) via an RS-485 serial network.  Up to 256 individaul devices can be controlled simultaneously and up to 200 cues per second can be sent over the network.
